Italian military engineers decided to adopt these innovations, but chose to use existing designs. The turret was based on the German turret from the advanced KPz 3 tank. The hull configuration was also adopted from German vehicles. At the same time, Italian engineers tried to increase the armor thickness to the maximum. To improve the projectile resistance of the frontal armor, it was decided to make it similar to the \"pike nose\" shape. Development was discontinued at the drafting stage.",

After prototype trials, the design was improved. In late 1944 and early 1945 two more prototypes underwent trials. The Object 701 No. 5 was recommended for adoption into service. However, production was called off in favor of the IS-3 just entering mass-production. After IS-3 production was suspended in 1946, production of the IS-4 began, continuing until 1949. A total of 25 IS-4M tanks were built in 1951. Later all previously produced tanks were modernized to the level of the IS-4M. According to different sources, between 235 and 258 vehicles were built in total; they were stationed in the Far East.",

The vehicle was designed as a \"universal tank\" to replace both the T-34 medium tank and KV heavy tank. The first prototype was built in the spring of 1942. The trials revealed the low durability of its modules. In addition, the vehicle required improved armor and a new turret for three crew members. Though the requirements were fulfilled and the development of two improved prototypes started in December 1942, the KV-13 medium tank project was discontinued in favor of the T-34. The two prototypes were subsequently used for the project of the mass produced IS-1 heavy tank, developed in 1943.",

Some chassis components were adopted from the IS-3, as well as the splash shields and spare parts kit. The rear machine gun was removed from the turret. It was replaced with an additional fan for the fighting compartment. All gun embrasures were sealed. In addition, the standard engine was replaced with the V-54K-IS engine. The ammo capacity was increased to 34–35 shells, while the standard gun (the 122 mm D-25) remained unchanged. However, the gun elevation mechanism was improved. Some vehicles were equipped with the TVN-2 night-vision devices. Besides this, the new R-113 radio was equipped instead of the standard one. In addition, the driver's observation devices were improved.",

These solutions provided high crossing capacity and survivability: the tank could continue moving even with damaged tracks. The placement of the hull above the suspension allowed for a large fighting compartment, and as a result, increased ammunition and an improved autoloader mechanism for a high rate of fire.

On August 8, 1944, the British organized an ambush at the edge of the wood near Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil and Sento. Joe Ekins, the Sherman gunner, laid fire on moving Tigers and destroyed all three German vehicles within 12 minutes. As it turned out, one of the tanks under No. 007 was commanded by the most successful German tank ace, Michael Wittmann, also known as \"The Black Baron\". However, it still remains unclear who destroyed Wittmann's tank as several British vehicles were engaged in that battle.",
