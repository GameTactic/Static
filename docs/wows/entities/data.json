They were outnumbered. At the appointed hour, they rose up and tried to overthrow their loyalist masters. They failed. They were defeated in a long, bloody war and all, to a man, perished in flames. Their name was erased from history. But the fickle whims of the Warp decreed that their vengeful spirits would forever haunt the vessel Ragnarok, whose hull was being constructed in the docks above the planet's surface. The furious spirits invaded the hull and ensured the vessel served none but the Ruinous Powers. To this day, Ragnarok and all aboard it cry, \"Vengeance! Death! Blood for the Blood God!\"",
