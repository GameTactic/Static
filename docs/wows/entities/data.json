Though the citizens adhered to the Imperial creed and paid their tithes, secret cabals on the planet's surface worshipped Khorne, the Lord of Rage. These cults were strong. They were hated. They were outnumbered. At the appointed hour, they rose up and tried to overthrow their loyalist masters. They failed. They were defeated in a long, bloody war and all, to a man, perished in flames. Their name was erased from history. But the fickle whims of the Warp decreed that their vengeful spirits would forever haunt the vessel Ragnarok, whose hull was being constructed in the docks above the planet's surface. The furious spirits invaded the hull and ensured the vessel served none but the Ruinous Powers. To this day, Ragnarok and all aboard it cry, \"Vengeance! Death! Blood for the Blood God!\"",

After missing for several millennia, the ship was rediscovered on one of the Frontier worlds in the Jericho Reach. Though clearly a warship, it was put to use as a transport by its new, uncouth masters who failed to recognize its true potential. After undergoing intensive repairs and cleansing its quarters of its previous inhabitants, Ignis Purgatio was eventually returned to Imperial Navy service and, since then, it has become an essential component of Battlefleet Solar. Once again, it acts as a fearsome guard dog for humanity and, by proxy, the Emperor Himself.",
